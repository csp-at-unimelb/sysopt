# SysOpt - Systems Modelling and Optimisation

## Overview
`sysopt` is a `python3` framework for component based modelling, simulation and optimisation of continuous time dynamic and control systems.

It allows users to design modular plant and control systems, simulate the trajectory of closed loop systems, and run joint parameter/path optimisation studies.

- Install via `pip install sysopt`
- Documentation and user guide at https://sysopt.readthedocs.io .
